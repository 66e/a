I did my best
我尽我所能

But I guess my best wasn't good enough
却依旧微不足道

'Cause here we are back where we were before
我们周而复始

Seems nothing ever changes
一切似乎依旧如故

We're back to being strangers
我们又变回了陌生人

Wondering if we oughta stay
不知是否该就此停留

Or head on out the door
又或是该踏门而出

Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong?
仅此一回,我们之间到底做错了什么?

Why we never last for very long
为何感情难以永葆

What are we doing wrong?
究竟我们做错了什么?

Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right?
仅此一回,我们还能否重归于好?

Make the magic last for more than just one night
让爱情永葆魔力,日久天长

If we could just get to it
如果我们患难与共

I know we could break through it
一定会柳暗花明又一村

I gave my all
我倾我所有

But I think my all may have been too much
为伊消得人憔悴

'Cause Lord knows we're not getting anywhere
但也许终究难得其所

Seems we're always blowing whatever we've got going
不管如何努力似乎还是格格不入

And seems at times with all we've got
我们之间总有隔阂

We haven't got a pray
我们得不到祝福

Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong?
仅此一回,我们之间到底做错了什么

Why the good times never last for very long
为何好时光难以留住

What are we doing wrong?
究竟我们做错了什么

Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right?
仅此一回,我们还能否重归于好

And make the magic last for more than just one night
让爱情永葆魔力,日久天长

If we could just get to it
如果我们同舟共济

I know we could break through it
一定会柳暗花明又一村

Just once I want to understand
仅此一次,我想弄明白

Why it always come back to good-bye
为何我们会分道扬镳

Why can't we get ourselves in hand?
为何我们总有缘无分

And admit to one another
明明两情相悦

That we're no good with out the other
明明需要彼此

Take the best and make it better
让爱情保存并幸福地爱着

Find a way to stay together
我们要觅迹至长相思守

Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right?
仅此一回,我们还能否重归于好

Make the magic last for more than just one night
让爱情永葆魔力,日久天长

I know we can break through it
我知道我们一定能突破重围

If we could just get to it
如果我们能够患难与共

Just once
只此一回

If we could get to it
只要我们患难与共

Just Once...
只此一回....
