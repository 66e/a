`'Cause every time I close my eyes, I think of you`

`And no matter what the season nears, I still love you`

`Wherever you are`

### Two Occasions

A summer love is beautiful but it's not enough

To satisfy emotions that are shared between us

A winter love is cozy but I need so much more

It just intensifies my wants to have a love that endures

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I think of you

And no matter what the season nears, I still love you

With all my heart and I wanna be with you

Wherever you are

I only think of you on two occasions

That's day and night

I'd go for broke if I could be with you

Only you can make it right

An autumn love is special at this time of the year

But when the leaves are gone, does that love disappear?

I never underestimate the new love of spring

But I'm glad to say in my heart, I know my love's lasting

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I think of you

And no matter what the season nears, I still love you

With all my heart and I wanna be with you

Wherever you are

I only think of you on two occasions

That's day and night

I'd go for broke if I could be with you

Only you can make it right, yeah

I only think of you on two occasions

That's day and night

I'd go for broke if I could be with you

Only you can make it right, yeah, yeah

'Cause every time I close my eyes, I think of you

And no matter what the season is, I still love you

With all my heart now the feeling will ever

Wherever you are

I only think of you on two occasions

That's day and night

I'd go for broke if I could be with you

Only you can make it right

I only think of you on two occasions

That's day and night

I'd go for broke if I could be with you

Only you can make it right

'Cause it brings my life away to love

You can make it right
