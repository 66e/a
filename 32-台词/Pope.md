U don't understand i ain't scared of u mutha f**kas

Kick it stir it like coffee
The pope
Stir it like muthaf**kin' coffee

The pope

The hell

This is the pope oh your car got mags that be dippy dippy d**e
But the whole damn nation got the same

Honey only flock 2 the bee that's the pope
Not the president with government lame
Put me on a slow movin' parlimentary hackin' bandwagon
U could put me little a** in the grave
Everytime u want it i'll be live bring a date
I mean computer when its over press save so u can be the president
U can be the president kick it
I'd rather be the pope rather be the pope
I'd rather be so happy
Yeah u can be the side effect

I'd rather be the d**e rather be the d**e
